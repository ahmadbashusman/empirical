Update at Your Own Risk: An Empirical Analysis
of Software and Firmware Vulnerabilities


## 0. Overview:
This repository accompanies the artifacts of the research paper "Update at Your Own Risk: An Empirical Analysis of Software and Firmware Vulnerabilities"
We present an emperical anaylsis of the potential causes of  update process vulnerabilities in computing systmes, laragly on IoT devices, and provide strategic appraoch on how to mitigate them.
